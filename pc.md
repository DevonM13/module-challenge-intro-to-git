## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git allows me to manage and monitor my code. Github is where my code is stored inside of repositories. 
3. Why do we create a branch?
Creating a branch allows you to work on the code without effecting the main branch.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
So the project manager can compare the code. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout main 
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git fetch' is a way of downloading new data to view in a local repository. 'git merge' needs git fetch in order to send thee new downloaded data to the directory.  Git push does both of what git fetch and git merge does in one action.  
7. What is a merge conflict?
This happens when Git isn't able to resolve any differences in code between two commits. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You have to go back and edit the code until it works.
